                    <p>
                        Cetățuia is a fortification built during the Habsburg period at the top of a hill sharing the
                        same name in Cluj-Napoca , in the Gruia district .
                        The citadel was built between 1715 and 1735 and was surrounded by bastions, according to the
                        plans of the military architect Giovanni Morando Visconti. The access gates from the west and
                        south no longer exist, only those from the south-east and north remain standing. Above the gates
                        and within the enclosure were various buildings that housed administrative quarters, a garrison,
                        and a weapons depot.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The fortification was built with the main purpose of ensuring control over the city, after the
                        passage of Transylvania under Austrian rule, but it was also used many times as a prison,
                        especially during the Revolution of 1848.
                        <br>
                        Little remains of the old citadel: part of the walls, four buildings, and the redoubt was
                        transformed into the Parachutist Tower. The whole complex was deeply affected by the landslides
                        in the area.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The Belvedere Hotel was built on the hill of the hill in the 1970s, and in 1995 a huge iron
                        cross was erected ( Crucea de pe Cetătuie din Cluj-Napoca ), in place of the one destroyed by
                        the communists in the 1950s . The original cross was erected in memory of those imprisoned here.

                        Alexandru Borza Cluj-Napoca University Botanic Garden, is a botanical garden located in the south part of Cluj. It was founded in 1872 by Hungarian linguist Sámuel Brassai. In addition to its role as a tourist destination, the garden also serves as a teaching and research center as part of the Babeș-Bolyai University. In 2010, the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony categorized it as a historical monument.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The garden is over 14 hectares in area, with over 10,000 plants found throughout the world. It is divided into ornamental, phytogeographic (geobotanical), systematic (taxonomical), economic, and medicinal sections.

                    <p>
                        The "Simion Bărnutiu" Central Park, colloquially the Great Park, in Hungarian Sétatér, with an age of over 180 years, is one of the main green spaces in the central area of ​​Cluj-Napoca. The park is bounded by the Cluj Arena to the west, the Hungarian State Theater to the east, the Someșul Mic river to the north, and Iuliu Hossu Street(formerly Pavlov) to the south. It is listed on the list of historical monuments in Cluj county, developed by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Heritage in 2010.

                    <p>
                        Since the beginning of the 19th century, the location of the current park has become a favorite meeting place for the city's middle-class residents. The first attempts to transform the place into a public park, however, did not enjoy the material and moral support of the noble families of Cluj, who owned large ornamental gardens

                        Iulius Parc covers an area of ​​three hectares and is an investment of over two million euros by the Iulius Group, made for the Cluj community.

                        The artists are represented in the gallery by the most important of their works, having in view both the revealing of the characteristic aspects of the multi-culture specificity in Transylvania and suggesting of the complex relations between the art in Romania and the main tendences and streams of the European one. By including fully consacrated values into the synthesis of national post-war art, created in Transylvania and especially in Cluj, the museum remains receptive also to the creations of more recent date.
