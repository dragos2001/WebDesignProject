                    <p>
                        On Christmas time in Cluj the square is nicely decorated and its centrepiece is an enormous Christmas tree with lights and presents underneath. The entrances all have arches decorated with gold lights. There is a big top like frame of lights in front of the main arena. The entire site looks pretty and especially brightened up when there is an act on the main stage. Each of the stalls has pleasant touches on too to reflect the theme of their wares.

                    <p>
                        The main ride in the Christmas fair is the Feris Wheel, which overlooks the entire site. This has fantastic views and is lit up with bright lights too. The other significant ride is the carrousel, which is more of a children’s ride.

                        The main stage in the square is pretty cool and has a fantastic lighting rig. A variety of performances will use the stage over the 6 week fair. This includes some iconic Romanian musicians, like Voltaj and Directia 5. These two were great on the opening weekend and despite the rain, the square had a great vibe.

                    <p>
                        There are a variety of stalls around the square selling all sorts of things. Many sell food to consume when at the festivities, including fast food, cakes and Kurtos. You can also purchase a variety of Christmas gifts, including some handmade items from Transylvania.

                        Also, many food producers use the market to sell their wares. The charcuterie and cheese stalls are particularly interesting and sometimes have free samples.

                    Just as the summer officially turns to autumn, between September 1st and 4th, another music festival lands in the city – or in the  park, for that matter. The Jazz festival in the National Ethnographic Park “Romulus Vuia” will take place in each afternoon and evening from Thursday to Sunday.

                    <p>
                    There will be dozens of jazz names performing, and this will be the 10th edition. It is the most important jazz festival in Romania, and in 2019 it was named Europe’s best small festival.

                    The park is just outside the city, in the middle of the nature, and fans can also visit a traditional open air museum.

                    <p>
                        The Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF) is the first international feature film festival in Romania, which is held annually in the historic capital of Transylvania, Cluj-Napoca. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It was founded in 2002 by the Romanian Film Promotion and has since grown rapidly to become the most important film-related event in Romania. It is a member of the Alliance of Central and Eastern European Film Festivals and it is supported by the Creative Europe – MEDIA Programme. In February 2011, TIFF has been accredited by the FIAPF as a "competitive festival specialised on first and second feature films". Indiewire listed it as one of the world's top 50 leading film festivals.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The festival takes place in 20 locations around the city, including outdoor and unconventional places. Transilvania IFF's main goal is the promotion of cinematic art by presenting some of the most innovative and spectacular films of the moment that feature both originality and independence of expression, that reflect unusual cinematic language forms or focus on current trends in youth culture. The competition is dedicated to first and second feature films.
