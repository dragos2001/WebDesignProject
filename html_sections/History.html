        <p>
            The history of Cluj-Napoca covers the time from the Roman conquest of Dacia,
            when a Roman settlement named Napoca existed on the location of the later city,
            through the founding of Cluj and its flourishing as the main cultural and religious
            center in the historical province of Transylvania, until its modern existence as a city,
            the seat of Cluj County in north-western Romania.

                <h2>Etymology of the Name</h2>
                <p>About the origin of the settlement's name Napoca or Napuca several hypotheses have been advanced. The most important are the following:
                    <br>•	Dacian name having the same root "nap" (cf. ancient Armenian root "nap") as that of the Dacian river Naparis attested by Herodotus, but with an augmentative suffix uk/ok i.e. over, great
                    <br>•	Name derived from that of the Dacianized Scythian tribe known as the Napae
                    <br>•	Name probably akin to an indigenous (Thracian) element in Romanian, the word năpârcă 'viper' cf. Albanian nepërkë, nepërtkë
                    <br>•	Name derived from the Ancient Greek term napos (νάπος), meaning "timbered valley"
                    <br>•	Name derived from the Indo-European root *snā-p- (Pokorny 971-2), "to flow, to swim, damp".
                    <br>Independent of these hypotheses, scholars agree that the name of the settlement predates the Roman conquest (AD 106)

                <h2>6B. Rauchbier</h2>
                <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong>  An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced, complementary beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are characteristic.</p>
                <p><strong>History:</strong> A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager. The smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries produce their own smoked malt (rauchmalz).</p>

                <h2>6C. Dunkles Bock</h2>
                <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A dark, strong, malty German lager beer that emphasizes the malty-rich and somewhat toasty qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.</p>
                <p><strong>History:</strong> Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck, which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th century). Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century. The name “bock” is based on a corruption of the name “Einbeck” in the Bavarian dialect, and was thus only used after the beer came to Munich. “Bock” also means “Ram” in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.</p>
