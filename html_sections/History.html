        <p>
            The history of Cluj-Napoca covers the time from the Roman conquest of Dacia,
            when a Roman settlement named Napoca existed on the location of the later city,
            through the founding of Cluj and its flourishing as the main cultural and religious
            center in the historical province of Transylvania, until its modern existence as a city,
            the seat of Cluj County in north-western Romania.

                        About the origin of the settlement's name Napoca or Napuca several hypotheses have been advanced. The most important are the following:
                        <br>•	Dacian name having the same root "nap" (cf. ancient Armenian root "nap") as that of the Dacian river Naparis attested by Herodotus, but with an augmentative suffix uk/ok i.e. over, great
                        <br>•	Name derived from that of the Dacianized Scythian tribe known as the Napae
                        <br>•	Name probably akin to an indigenous (Thracian) element in Romanian, the word năpârcă 'viper' cf. Albanian nepërkë, nepërtkë
                        <br>•	Name derived from the Ancient Greek term napos (νάπος), meaning "timbered valley"
                        <br>•	Name derived from the Indo-European root *snā-p- (Pokorny 971-2), "to flow, to swim, damp".
                        <br>Independent of these hypotheses, scholars agree that the name of the settlement predates the Roman conquest (AD 106)

                        The oldest human settlement near Cluj, dating from the Neolithic Age, is at Gura Baciului, near Suceagu,
                        in the valley of a tributary of the Nadăș river and nearby the Hoia Forest. The settlement dates back to 6000–5500 BCE,
                        making it the oldest in Transylvania.[citation needed] Archaeologists have connected it with the Starčevo–Kőrös–Criş culture,
                        and other similar settlements have been discovered since: a tomb from this same culture in the Mănăștur district, and another
                        settlement on the Strada Memorandumului.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Traces of the Thracian-Dacians and Celts suggest that the region was occupied intermittently throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages.
                        As economies centered around cattle-raising developed in the Pannonian plain, the importance of the salt trade with the Transylvanian
                        Plain became ever more important. Two major routes, one running north–south and the other east–west, met on the right end of a ford
                        under the promontory of a hill, today named Cetățuie. Presumably there was at one time a Dacian fortress controlling this central
                        communication point, which would later have been destroyed in the early 18th century construction of Austrian fortifications.

                                The Romans conquered Dacia between AD 101 and 106 under Trajan, and a Roman settlement of Napoca
                                is first recorded on a milestone found in 1758 in the nearby Aiton commune.

                                The Milliarium of Aiton is an ancient Roman milestone (milliarium) dating from 108 AD, shortly after the conquest,
                                evidence of the construction of a road from Potaissa to Napoca. It indicates a distance of ten thousand feet (P.M.X.)
                                to Potaissa. This is the first epigraphical attestation of the settlements of Potaissa and Napoca in Roman Dacia.
                                This milliarium is evidence of a road known to be built by Cohors I Hispanorum miliaria.

                                Trajan's successor Hadrian granted the title and rank of municipium to the Roman settlement at Napoca naming it
                                municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as
                                Colonia Aurelia Napoca, probably during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.

                                Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was abandoned
                                in 274 by the Roman administration. During the Migrations Period Napoca was overrun and destroyed. There are no references
                                to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter. Villages did spring up on the nearby
                                countryside which displayed continuation in culture from the Roman period, likely populated by settlers that had abandoned
                                the city.

                                After the departure of the Romans to the southern banks of the Danube in the 3rd century,
                                nothing is certain about the site's history as a settlement until the Hungarians (Magyars)
                                arrived in Pannonia in the 9th Century. The modern city of Cluj-Napoca was founded by German
                                settlers as Klausenburg in the 13th Century. The name "Napoca" was added to the traditional
                                Romanian city name "Cluj" by dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1974 as a means of asserting Romanian
                                claims to the region on the basis of the theory of Daco-Roman Continuity. Although the precise
                                date of the conquest of Transylvania by the Hungarians is not known, the earliest Hungarian
                                artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century. After the
                                conquest, the city became part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

                                King Stephen I made the city the seat of the castle county of Kolozs, and King Saint Ladislaus
                                I of Hungary founded the abbey of Cluj-Mănăştur (Kolozsmonostor), destroyed during the Tatar
                                invasions in 1241 and 1285. As for the civilian colony, a castle and a village were built
                                to the northwest of the ancient Napoca no later than the late 12th century. This new village
                                was settled by large groups of Transylvanian Saxons, encouraged during the reign of Crown Prince
                                Stephen, Duke of Transylvania.

                                of Hungary, when the village (Villa Kulusvar) was granted to the Bishop of Transylvania. On
                                August 19, 1316, during the rule of the new king, Charles I of Hungary, Cluj was granted the status
                                of a city (Latin: civitas), as a reward for the Saxons' contribution to the defeat of the rebellious
                                Transylvanian voivode, Ladislaus Kán. In memory of this event, the Saint Michael Church started
                                to be built.

                        In 1541 Klausenburg became part of the autonomous Principality of Transylvania after the Ottoman Turks
                        occupied the central part of the Hungarian Kingdom. Although Alba Iulia served as political capital for
                        the Principality of Siebenbürgen (Transylvania), Klausenburg was the main cultural and religious center
                        for the principality. In 1581, Stefan Batory, Governor of Transylvania, took the initiative in founding
                        a Jesuit academy in Klausenburg.

                    <p>
                        Between 1545 and 1570, large numbers of Germans (Saxons) left the city due to the introduction of Unitarian
                        doctrines. The remaining Germans were assimilated to Hungarians, and the city became a centre for Hungarian
                        nobility and intellectuals. With the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, Klausenburg became part of the Habsburg
                        monarchy.

                                From 1790 to 1848 and again from 1861 to 1867, Klausenburg was the capital of the Grand
                                Principality of Transylvania (Siebenbürgen) within the Austrian Empire; the city was also
                                the seat of the Transylvanian diets. Beginning in 1830, the city became the centre of the
                                Hungarian national movement within the principality. During the Revolutions of 1848,
                                Klausenburg was taken and garrisoned in December by Hungarian troops under the command of
                                the Polish general Józef Bem.

                                In 1776, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria founded a German university in Cluj. But this
                                enterprise was not to survive long, Emperor Joseph II replacing the university with the
                                famous Piarist Highschool, where the teaching was done in Latin. The first Hungarian-language
                                newspaper was published in Klausenburg in 1791, and the first Hungarian theatrical company
                                was established in 1792. In 1798, the city was heavily damaged by a fire. For lighting, oil
                                lamps were introduced in 1826, gas lamps in 1861 and electric lights in 1906.

                                Transylvania were again integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary. During this time, Kolozsvar
                                was among the largest and most important cities of the kingdom, and was the seat of Kolozs
                                County. In 1897, the Hungarian government decided that only Hungarian place names should be
                                used and therefore prohibited the use of the German or Romanian versions of the city's name

                                In 1872, the authorities established a University in Cluj, with teaching exclusively in
                                Hungarian, which caused discontent amongst the Romanian population. In 1881 the University
                                was renamed Franz Joseph University after Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.

                                After World War I, Cluj became part of the Kingdom of Romania, along with the rest of Transylvania. The Romanian authorities took over the University of Cluj, transforming it into a Romanian institution. On May 12, 1919, the Romanian University of Cluj was set up, with King Ferdinand proclaiming the University open on February 1, 1920.

                                In 1940 Cluj was returned to Hungary through the Second Vienna Award, but Hungarian forces in the city were defeated by the Soviet and Romanian armies in October 1944. Cluj was restored to Romania by the Treaty of Paris in 1947. The Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal was set up in Cluj by the post-World War II government of Romania, overseen by the Allied Control Commission, to try suspected war criminals. The Cluj Tribunal passed a total of 100 death sentences, 163 sentences of life imprisonment, and a range of other sentences.

                                After World War II, the Romanian university (which had moved to Sibiu and Timișoara in the aftermath of the Second Vienna Award) returned to Cluj and took the name "Babeş", after the scientist Victor Babeş. Parts of the Hungarian university moved to Szeged and were later named University of Szeged, which became one of the most distinguished universities in Hungary and in Central Europe. The remaining parts formed the Hungarian University of Cluj and took the name "Bolyai", after the mathematician János Bolyai. The two universities, the Romanian Babeş University and the Hungarian Bolyai University, merged in 1959 forming the Babeş-Bolyai University, with teaching in both Romanian and Hungarian. Nowadays, this is the largest university in Romania.

                                Hungarians remained the majority of the city's population until the 1960s, when for the first time in its long history, Romanians outnumbered Hungarians. According to the 1966 census, the city's population of 185,663 was composed of 56% Romanians and 41% Hungarians. Until 1974 the official Romanian name of the city was Cluj. It was renamed to Cluj-Napoca by the Communist government to recognize it as the site of the Roman colony Napoca.

                                Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the nationalist politician Gheorghe Funar became mayor for 12 years. His tenure was marked by strong Romanian nationalistic and anti-Hungarian ideas. A number of public art projects were undertaken by the city with the aim of highlighting Romanian symbols of the city, most of them regarded by Hungarian ethnics as a way of obscuring the city's Hungarian ancestry. In June 2004 Gheorghe Funar was voted out of office. He was replaced by Emil Boc of the Democratic Party. The laws on municipal bilingualism have not been applied in administration as the 2002 city census showed less than 20% Hungarians.
