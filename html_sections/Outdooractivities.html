                Only 13 km from Turda, one of the most beautiful and impressive gorge areas in Romania is revealed: Turda Gorge – a Nature Reserve.
                Turda Gorge formed over 150 million years as a result of the surface-forming activity of Hașdate River, a small tributary of Arieș River, in the Jurassic limestones of Trascău Mountains.
                Legend and reality intimately linked, Turda Gorge takes your breath away with its majesty and richness. It covers an area of 170 hectares, has a length of almost two kilometres and nearly 350 meters difference in altitude.

                Rock walls, up to 200 meters high, mysterious caves, rare plants, and hiking trails make Turda Gorge an impressive place. A smooth road winds through the hills covered by forest, which then opens up into the rocky landscape.
                The complex – geological, floristic, faunistic, and archaeological reserve – where the area is located gives home to more than 60 caves, such as the Hungarian Cave, Morarilor Cave, Binder Cave, Cetățuia Mare and Cetățuia Mică Caves, Modoloaie Cave, or the Hidden Cave, as well as to a series of rocky corners, columns, and steep walls. A special place is the stone cathedral called Turnul Ascuțit (The Sharp Tower) with Hili’s Cave, where there is an impressive via ferrata route, next to Coltul Cetății (The Castle Corner), Yellow Tower, and Bors Tower.

              <p>Salina Turda  is a salt mine in the Durgău-Valea Sărată area of Turda, the second largest city in Cluj County, northwest Romania. Opened for tourists in 1992, the Salina Turda mine was visited by about 618,000 Romanian and foreign tourists in 2017.[2]

              Salina Turda was ranked in 2013 by Business Insider as among the "25 hidden gems around the world that are worth the trek".</p>

                    <p>In Theresa Mine, the underground lake dominates the scene majestically. A unique splendour of up to 6 meters deep, extended on about 80% of the base surface of the exploitation room. Over time, an island was formed in the centre of the lake, from the residual salt deposited here after 1880, the year in which salt exploitation in this room was stopped. Exactly here, in this area, the air is the cleanest, with the lowest total concentration of microorganisms in the underground air of 4–10 microbial bodies.</p>

                <p>Welcome to the Rudolf Mine, an impressive underground world that overwhelms you with its grandeur, a veritable treasure from the depths, named in honour of Prince Rudolf of Austria.
                  The trapezoidal dome of Rudolf Mine is 42 meters deep, 50 wide, and 80 long, a true work of art. Rudolf Mine is also the last place where salt was exploited in Turda.
                  172 steps lead you to the heart of the mine. You go down 13 floors, at each resting bridge being marked on the wall the year when the respective level was exploited.
                  On the northwestern semi-ceiling, stalactites of salt have been formed over the years. They follow the direction of an intercalation of high- purity macrocrystalline salt (over 99.9% NaCl).</p>

          <h4 class="article_heading"> Tarnita Lake</h4>


          <div class="article_item">
            <p>Tarniţa Lake is an accumulation lake located on Someşul Cald river. It has an area of ​​over 200 ha, and the existing dam is built of concrete in the shape of an arch, with a height of 97 m, a crest length of 237 m, having as main purpose the production of electricity.

              The lake is the main source of water supply for the treatment station in Gilău, a station that supplies drinking and industrial water for Cluj-Napoca and other areas in Cluj County.
              
              Periodically, various swimming or sport fishing competitions are organized by sports associations.</p>

          <div class="article_item">
            <p>The deep, dark blue waters that do not allow scrutinizing have inspired many urban legends about monsters inhabiting the bottom of the lake. One of them has it that a descendant of the Loch Ness monster lives in Tarnița. Another: that the lake is teeming with fish three-meter long, which attack the swimmers and the boats. This second legend is motivated by the real stories of the people who drowned in the lake, their bodies never being recovered.</p>
